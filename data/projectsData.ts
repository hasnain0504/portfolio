    title: 'Custom Jewelry Image Generator',
    description:
      'Designed and fine-tuned a deep generative model using Stable Diffusion and LoRA for controlled jewelry image synthesis. Built the full training and inference pipeline in PyTorch, implemented structured prompt construction, and evaluated prompt–image alignment using CLIP-based similarity metrics.',

    title: 'Multiclass Object Detection & Few-Shot Learning',
    description:
      'Trained and evaluated multi-class image models using ResNet-50, MobileNet, and EfficientNet on Tiny ImageNet. Integrated Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for few-shot classification, improving accuracy by 15% over fine-tuned baselines, with reproducible training and evaluation pipelines.',

    title: 'Automated Gas Meter Reading',
    description:
      'Built an IoT-based deep learning system for automated gas meter reading using computer vision. Achieved 94% accuracy by combining morphological image processing with transfer learning (ResNet50, EfficientNet, LeNet) and ensemble bagging to improve robustness and reduce overfitting.',
